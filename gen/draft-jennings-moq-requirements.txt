                 Media Delivery Over QUIC Requirements
                       draft-jennings-moq-reqs-00

Abstract

   Delivering media over QUIC has piqued interest among use-cases that
   span the streaming media and real-time media domains, as is evident
   from the discussions on the "moq@ietf.org" mailing list.  Any
   solution that addresses these use-cases should take into account
   requirements from these domains.

   This document is an attempt to compile a common set of requirements
   that is charactersitics of use-cases that a proposed solution might
   attempt to solve.

1.  Introduction

   Delivering media over QUIC has piqued interest among use-cases that
   span the streaming media and real-time media domains, as is evident
   from the discussions on the "moq@ietf.org" mailing list.  Any
   solution that addresses these use-cases should take into account
   requirements from these domains.

   draft-gruessing-moq-requirements-00.txt captures various usecases and
   IETF drafts the are currently active for delivering media over QUIC.
   This document considers its inputs from draft-gruessing-moq-
   requirements-00.txt as well as active discusisons on the
   "moq@ietf.org" mailing list with a scope to distil the high level
   requirements for use-cases/applications where a UDP based transport
   (like QUIC) is considered and has characteristics of real-time and
   streaming media flows.

2.  Contributing

   All significant discussion of development of this protocol is in the
   GitHub issue tracker at TODO.

3.  Terminology

   *  Relay - a server in the cloud that can receive subscriptions and
      send data it receives in. publish to other endpoints that have
      subscribed to the data.

   *  Sender/Publisher: An endpoint that sends data to a Relay.

   *  Receiver/Subscribers: An endpoint that subscribes to data from
      Relay and receives data.  Relays can act as subscribers to other
      relays.

   *  Client: An endpoint that acts as a Publisher, Subscriber, or both.

   *  Upstream: Sending data from Publisher to Relay

   *  Downstream: Sending data from Relay to a Subscriber

4.  Use cases

   Following lists a sampling of usecases that could be benefitted by
   the media delivery solution as part of the "media-over-quic" efforts

   *  Live stream a football game on multiple devices and have the
      playout synchronized but also have the overall; latency be fairly
      low (sub seconds aprox 250 ms on same contient )

   *  Live auctions.

   *  Gaming where all players need to see “ (U+201C)moves” (U+201D) or
      “ (U+201C)cards” (U+201D) at same time.

   *  Live Music with musicians all in same locations.

   *  Distributed band with interactive media session in parallel.

   *  Push to Talk Media for Fronline communicantions.

   *  [ More to come here ?]

5.  Requirements

   *  The solution SHALL deliver the media where playout can be
      synchronized within 50 ms.

   *  Various media qualities from extremely low bitrate audio to high-
      end video SHALL be supported.

   *  The solution SHALL be extensibe in supporting various media types,
      such as audio, video, 3d models, volumetric video, light-fields,
      game moves and so on.

   *  The solution SHALL be able to support highly scalable (streaming
      to millions of viewers) as well as 1:1 use-cases.

   *  The soluton SHALL allow for leveraging on path caches like CDNs
      wherever applicable to improve the latency and bandwidth
      requirements.

   *  The solution should work over UDP with servers / caches with
      public IP addresses.

   *  The solution SHALL support for multiple media encodings and
      ability for clients to select the appropriate encoding . Layered
      encodings (dependent) and simulcast (independent) encodings shall
      be supported.

   *  The solution SHALL provides at least the circuit break level for
      the congestion control.  It shall provide information for encodor
      rate adaptation in senders.

   *  The soution SHALL support the plug-in ability for new congestion
      control algorithms.

   *  The solution SHALL provide End-to-End encryption and
      confidentiality of the media data, possibly keyable with MLS.

   *  The solution shall enable plug in and negotiable error recovery/
      correction per hop.

   *  The solution shall enable the API to provide hints about the
      relative importance, reliability and latency characteristics for
      the various media flows.

   *  The solution shall enable cloud first deployments - cloud
      friendly, horizontally scalable and highly available as with a
      typical modern cloud application.

   *  The solution shall support a relay to move senders and receivers
      to talk to different relay (like HTTP redirect) to enable things
      like moving traffic between relays, say due to relay shutdown or
      as instructed by a load balancer.

   *  The solution should enable easy to use developer API.

   *  The solution shall enable an easy way to map the constructs to
      last mile streaming models like HLS/DASH.

   *  The solution shall enable mapping to real-time point to point
      media constructs in the likes SIP/WebRTC.

   *  [ More to come here ??]
